## Hi, I'm Ola Moore. 👋

💼 I'm a data analyst based in Charlotte, currently working in the financial sector.

👀 I’m interested in providing an overall better user experience by providing helpful data that would allow line of business to make more informed decisions.  The tools I primarily use are Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau.

💞️ I absolutely enjoy learning new things.  I believe that each person should allow themselves to learn something new and be open to change.
